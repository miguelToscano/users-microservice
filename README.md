# Users API
### MVC architectural pattern
The app is divided into three components.
### 1. Controllers
They work as endpoints entry points. They're responsible for validating incoming data and calling services to handle business logic.
### 2. Services
They handle business logic.
### 3. Domain
Here we model our business entities, in this case: users.
